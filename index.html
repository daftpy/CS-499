      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          This portfolio represents my progression from building small course projects to implementing
          secure, scalable, and maintainable systems that reflect industry practices. Throughout the program,
          I strengthened core competencies across software design, algorithms & data structures, databases,
          security, and communication.
        </p>

        <h4>Collaboration & Communication</h4> 
        <p>
          Throughout each enhancement, I worked with the 
          same care and structure used in professional projects. I documented design decisions in detailed 
          Microsoft Word documents, wrote clear inline comments, and prepared my code for review and feedback. 
          I tailored explanations for different audiences by writing several README files, technical notes 
          for developers, and concise narratives and reflection journals for non-technical readers.
        </p>
        <p>I also focused on process transparency and maintainability. I used meaningful commit messages, organized 
          repository structure and issue notes, and included setup instructions so others could reproduce results 
          quickly. I incorporated instructor feedback into revisions, clarified UI where needed, 
          and kept documentation synchronized with my changes to make sure the rationale behind my choices
          remained were easy to understand.
        </p>

        <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
        <p>
          I used engineering best practices throughout my work, 
          using Docker Compose to containerize services and maintain a clear separation between the application, database, 
          and authentication layers. This modular architecture simplified deployment, made local testing more predictable, 
          and mirrored production-like environments you find on professional teams. I also adopted an API-first mindset, designing endpoints and data 
          models before implementing user interfaces to ensure consistency across systems. On the Android side, I 
          reinforced clean architecture principles by separating UI, networking, and persistence logic into distinct layers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To enhance reliability, I implemented health checks, error handling, and liveness endpoints that improved 
          observability across services. These changes not only made the application more fault-tolerant but also helped 
          streamline debugging and performance monitoring. The result is a project that demonstrates modern full-stack 
          practices while remaining easy to extend and maintain.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Structures & Algorithms.</h4>
        <p>
          I designed efficient data-driven features that analyze and 
          interpret time-series weight data. The enhancements include a seven-entry rolling average to smooth out 
          short-term fluctuations and an ordinary least squares regression to calculate a trend line and projected 
          goal-achievement date. Each algorithm runs in predictable O(<span class="kbd">n</span>) time and was implemented 
          with clear preconditions and edge-case handling to prevent misleading outputs. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to algorithmic accuracy, I focused on readability and maintainability. I documented mathematical 
          logic with concise inline comments and structured methods so future developers could easily extend the analytics 
          layer with additional computations. These improvements reflect my ability to integrate algorithmic reasoning into 
          practical, user-facing applications.
        </p>

        <h4>Databases</h4>
        <p>
          I implemented an offline-first data model that synchronizes a 
          local SQLite cache with a cloud-hosted MySQL database via RESTful API. The app retrieves cached data instantly 
          for responsiveness, then performs background synchronization to maintain accuracy and consistency. This design 
          balances performance and reliability while allowing users to continue tracking data even without connectivity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also focused on schema alignment between local and remote databases to avoid conflicts during synchronization, 
          ensuring timestamp and ID integrity across both systems. These improvements demonstrate practical skills in 
          database normalization, API integration, and data reliability, creating a seamless bridge between client storage 
          and cloud persistence.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Security Mindset</h4>
        <p>
          I used standards-based authentication (Keycloak + OpenID Connect),
          validated JWTs server-side, and encrypted tokens at rest on Android using the Android Keystore.
          This aligns with Zero Trust principles by verifying every request and scoping data per user.
          I also implemented HTTPS for all network communication and enforced secure token lifecycles to prevent replay attacks.
          Together, these measures ensure data confidentiality and integrity while maintaining a seamless user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, these artifacts demonstrate my readiness to contribute to full-stack or mobile teams
          focused on cloud-based deployments, security, and user-friendly software. Through this work, I met
          the key CS-499 outcomes by designing secure, scalable systems (Outcome 4), applying algorithmic
          principles to real-world problems (Outcome 3), and maintaining a security-first approach in
          architecture and implementation (Outcome 5). Together, these experiences reflect technical
          depth and professional growth across the multiple areas of computer science.

    <h2>Code Review</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I began this project by conducting an informal code review to assess the current architecture, identify risks,
        and prioritize my enhancements. The review focused on structure and readability, API design, security concerns
        (authentication and token handling), and database schema alignment. This gave me a concrete roadmap for the 
        three enhancements I made and ensured each one mapped to a course outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The screencast below walks through the existing functionality, targeted improvements, and the plan for each
        enhancement with clear alignment to the course outcomes.

            <em>Weight Tracker API & Android Client (Containerized, Authenticated Architecture)</em><br/>
            Refactored the original local-only app into a service-based system: Dockerized REST API (Node/Express),
            MySQL persistence, Keycloak OIDC authentication, and an Android client using a typed networking layer.
            Emphasis on modularity, reliability, and secure request handling.

            Added a 7-entry rolling average to smooth noise and an ordinary least squares regression to estimate
            slope (lb/day) and project a goal date. Handles edge cases explicitly (e.g., insufficient data,
            non-decreasing trends) and integrates directly into the Grid view without extra network calls.

          <p>
            <em>Offline-First SQLite Cache + Cloud MySQL Sync</em><br/>
            Implemented a cache layer via <code>DatabaseHelper</code>. The app renders cached weights immediately,
            then fetches fresh data from the API, replacing the cache on success. Goals are cached as a singleton.
            This provides fast first paint, graceful offline behavior, and eventual consistency.
