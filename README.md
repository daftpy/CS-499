# Alexander Flood – CS-499 ePortfolio  
**Southern New Hampshire University · Computer Science Capstone (Fall 2025)**  

This repository contains my final capstone project for **CS-499**, demonstrating growth across the core domains of computer science:  
- **Software Design & Engineering**  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**  
- **Databases**  

It includes all enhanced artifacts, reflection narratives, and my professional self-assessment, hosted publicly through GitHub Pages.

## Overview

This project builds on earlier coursework and integrates industry practices such as **containerized microservices**, **secure authentication**, and **data-driven analytics**.  
Artifacts have been enhanced to align with the **CS-499 course outcomes**, demonstrating my ability to design, implement, and document scalable and secure computing solutions.

## Artifacts

### 1. Software Design & Engineering  
Refactored a local-only Android app into a **containerized microservice architecture** with a REST API, MySQL database, and Keycloak authentication via Docker Compose.

### 2. Algorithms & Data Structures  
Implemented **O(n)** rolling average and **OLS regression** analytics to provide user insights and performance trends.
